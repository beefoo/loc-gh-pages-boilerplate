# LoC Github Pages Boilerplate template

This is a boilerplate front-end template for LoC staff distributing open source code through Github Pages. This is the "bare-bones" version which is appropriate for bespoke and complex web interfaces written in Vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

It includes a simple HTML page with a LoC header and footer along with a CSS stylesheet and LoC logo.
